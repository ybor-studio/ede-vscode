# RemoteAuthorityResolver Implementation Notes

## Current Status
We've successfully implemented a `RemoteAuthorityResolver` with `tunnelFactory` but it's not being called because VS Code only invokes remote authority resolvers when actually in a remote context (SSH, containers, etc.).

## Key Implementation Details

### Class Structure
```typescript
class TunnelProvider implements vscode.PortAttributesProvider, vscode.RemoteAuthorityResolver
```

### Core Methods Implemented

1. **`resolve(authority, context)`** - Returns resolved authority info
   - Currently returns `ResolvedAuthority("localhost", 443)` + tunnel information
   - Has logging: `üîç RESOLVE METHOD CALLED`

2. **`tunnelFactory(tunnel, options, token)`** - Creates actual tunnels
   - Converts "ede" authority to real proxy URLs using `REMOTE` template
   - Has logging: `üöá TUNNEL FACTORY CALLED`

3. **Registration**
   - `vscode.workspace.registerRemoteAuthorityResolver("ede", this)`
   - Successfully registered (logs show "Remote Authority Resolver registered successfully")

### Tunnel Information
- `environmentTunnels` use `remoteAddress: {host: "ede", port: 8080}`
- `localAddress` remains "localhost:8080" for UI display
- When tunnelFactory is called, converts "ede" ‚Üí actual proxy URL

### Current Problem
**Neither `resolve()` nor `tunnelFactory()` methods are being called** because:
- VS Code only calls RemoteAuthorityResolver in remote contexts
- `vscode.workspace.openTunnel()` throws "cannot open tunnel" in local context
- Comment in API: "@throws When run in an environment without a remote"

## What to Test in Remote Environment

1. **Verify resolver methods are called**
   - Look for `üîç RESOLVE METHOD CALLED` in logs
   - Look for `üöá TUNNEL FACTORY CALLED` in logs

2. **Test tunnel creation flow**
   - Run `ede-vscode.tunnel.open` command
   - Should see authority "ede" being resolved to actual proxy URLs
   - Tunnels should be created with real remote addresses

3. **Environment Variables**
   ```
   EDE_PROXY_PORTS=3000,8080
   EDE_PROXY_URI=https://{{port}}--ede--ybor-studio-ede--67192fcb3a0928a27464e506.eks.us-east-2.aws.dev.ybor-studio.p6m.run
   ```

## Expected Flow in Remote Context
1. User runs `ede-vscode.tunnel.open localhost:8080`
2. VS Code sees tunnel with `remoteAddress: {host: "ede", port: 8080}`
3. VS Code calls `resolve("ede", context)` ‚Üí returns authority info
4. VS Code calls `tunnelFactory(tunnelOptions)` ‚Üí creates tunnel with real proxy URL
5. Tunnel works with actual remote endpoint

## Key Files
- `src/tunnels.ts` - Main implementation
- Current authority: "ede" 
- Remote URI template: `REMOTE` variable using EDE_PROXY_URI

## Debugging Commands
- Check logs for resolver method calls
- Test with: `ede-vscode.tunnel.open` and `ede-vscode.tunnel.scan`
- Verify tunnel descriptions in forwarded ports view
